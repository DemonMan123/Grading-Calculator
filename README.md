# Grading-Calculator by Demin
**IMPORTANT**
Requires you to run the following command while in the directory of the program:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This is just a simple calculator I was asked to build for someone, publising updated code here. Includes a GUI and a commandline-based version of it.
